# ARM (Anti-Forensic Redundant Malware)
**Authors**: Joe Bartelmo, Robert Suter, Andrew Botschagow

ARM is a proof of concept for forensics tools to show how malware can manifests itself across the Windows operating system. It will not contain a malware payload. Rather, if it's present it will simply write an artifact to the computer. 

### Functionality

ARM will have several key functions:

1) Anti fuzzy hashing (probably a genetic algorithm) -- the malware will attempt to change itself on launch and storage in a new location to avoid detection by common fuzzy hashing algorithms.
2) File system Redundancy -- malware will do a simple storage of itself in directories that are not clearly evident to the user (temp/prefetch (if possible)/ sys32 / etc...)
3) Slack space redundancy -- the malware will attempt to store itself across multiple slack spaces (or 1 large slack space) on the drive
4) Unallocated space redundancy -- the malware will attempt to store itself in an unallocated section of the hard drive
5) Encrypted Redundancy -- the malware will encrypt itself using multiple algorithms under different sections of the drive ( all of the listed)
6) ADS redundancy (hiding in data of another file) -- the malware will obscure itself within an alternative data stream to hide from plain sight
7) This malware will have a centralized launch from services to establish redundancy at a fixed time or when a user action occurs -- currently undecided on how this will trigger
8) Registry redundancy, will attempt to obscure itself in the registry


We plan on having a main entry point that will allow a set of options to manifest itself.
